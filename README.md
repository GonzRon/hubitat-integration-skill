Hubitat Integration with Mycroft

## About
A skill to teach Mycroft how to send commands to the Hubitat Zigbee/ZWave hub based on spoken 
commands.  This skill can deal with any Hubitat device that is enabled in the Hubitat "Maker" app
and which has commands "on", "off" and "setLevel", so essentially any switched outlets, lights,
dimmers, and scene activators.

You can also ask it to scan for new devices that Hubitat has made available to it, and you can
list the devices it know (but that takes a while)

The worst fault is that Mycroft does not know the word "Hubitat"

## Examples
* "Turn on the bookcase lights"
* "Turn off the overhead light"
* "Set the overhead light to 50%"
* "Scan for new devices"
* "Show me the devices you have"
